To me, creating with code has been a lifelong passion. Beginning in grade school, nothing has made me feel more creative than writing beautifully functional applications and exploring the code behind them. Recently I also discovered my passion for sharing and teaching this love to others. 

I spend my days now creating awesome things at Influitive and teaching awesome things and HackerYou.
